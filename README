ccash_cmd - command line interface for ccash servers
====================================================
ccash_cmd makes requests to servers running the CCash API. The command line
options make forming and sending a request very fast. ccash_cmd then formats
the data returned from the server for ease of viewing.

Requirements
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install ccash_cmd (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of ccash_cmd is done by creating a custom config.h and
(re)compiling the source code. This keeps it fast, secure, and simple.
